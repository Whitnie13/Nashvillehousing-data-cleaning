In this project, PostgreSQL was used to clean up a real estate dataset. SQL queries were used to correct the dataset's duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent formatting. The ROW_NUMBER() function was used to remove duplicate entries, the WHERE clause was used to remove missing values, UPDATE statements and regular expressions were used to fix formatting errors, and the data types were changed to match the data. After exporting the cleaned data for additional analysis and modeling, a more accurate and reliable dataset with increased insights and decision-making abilities was created.
